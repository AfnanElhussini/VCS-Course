# VCS-Course Lab01

## Introduction
This README file documents my first session in version control system, including the concepts, tools, and workflows that I was introduced to. It serves as a record of my learning journey and a reference for future sessions.

## Overview
- Version control system basics, including the difference between Git and other version control systems.
- Git commands, including `init`, `add`, `commit`, `status`, `log`, and `branch`.
- The Git workflow, including how to create and switch between branches, make changes, and merge changes back into the main branch.
- GitHub, including how to create a repository, push changes to the repository, and collaborate with others.

## Steps
Here are the steps that I took during the session:

1. Installed Git on my local machine and created a new repository using the `git init` command.
2. Created a new file in the repository and added it to the staging area using the `git add` command.
3. Committed the changes to the repository using the `git commit` command, including a helpful commit message.
4. Created a new branch using the `git branch` command and switched to the new branch using the `git checkout` command.
5. Made some changes to the file in the new branch and committed the changes using the `git commit` command.
6. Merged the changes from the new branch back into the main branch using the `git merge` command.
7. Created a new repository on GitHub and pushed the changes from my local repository to the GitHub repository using the `git push` command.

During these steps, I encountered some issues, such as merge conflicts and errors when pushing to GitHub, but was able to resolve them with the help of my instructor Guidelines.

## Reflection
Overall, I found my first session in version control system to be very informative and useful. I learned a lot about the basics of Git and how to use it to manage my code and collaborate with others. I can see how version control system can save time and reduce errors in my work, and I look forward to using it in future projects.
